# All_Regression_Methods_on_Tips
# Tipping Behavior Analysis in Restaurants

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to help restaurants better understand tipping behavior, enabling them to tailor services and optimize operations based on insights gained from a predictive model. Using a dataset of customer billing and demographic details, we aim to:
1. Identify factors that significantly impact tip amounts.
2. Develop accurate predictive models for estimating tips.
3. Provide actionable insights for improving customer service strategies and revenue management.

## Dataset
Dataset URL: [Tip Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xkm84DEOHqZ6YNnNP3jzerpUPU6LoCyJ/view?usp=sharing)

The dataset contains customer billing details, demographic information, and tip amounts.

## Objectives
1. **Significance Analysis**: Identify which factors have the most influence on tip amounts.
2. **Prediction Accuracy**: Build and evaluate models to accurately predict tip amounts.
3. **Management Insights**: Offer actionable recommendations to enhance service and increase revenue based on tipping trends.

## Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical features.
   - Normalize/scale numerical features as required.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - **Scatter Plot**: Visualize individual features against the tip amount to assess direct relationships.
   - **Pair Plot**: Examine multiple features simultaneously to uncover multi-feature correlations.
   - **Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)**: Identify linear relationships between variables.
   - **Statistical Test (Rainbow Test)**: Conduct tests to validate the assumption of linearity between predictors and the target variable.
   - **Residuals Plot**: Evaluate model fit by visualizing residuals of each model.
   - **Line Plot**: Analyze trends over time, if applicable.

### 3. Model Development
   - Implement various regression techniques:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **Ridge and Lasso Regression**: Apply regularization techniques to handle multicollinearity.
     - **Decision Tree Regression**
     - **Ensemble Methods**: Use Random Forest for improved performance.
     - **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
     - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression**
   - Assess models based on prediction accuracy metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared).

### 4. Model Selection
   - Compare models to identify the most suitable regression technique based on data trends.
   - Evaluate the accuracy of each model to select the best predictor for tips.

### 5. Insights for Management
   - Derive actionable insights for restaurant management, helping improve customer experience and tipping rates.
   - Summarize key findings on factors influencing tips and recommend strategies based on model results.
